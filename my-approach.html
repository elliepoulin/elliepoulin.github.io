                Psychotherapy is more than just talking. While discussing your challenges can offer temporary relief, true internal and external change comes from a deeper process. My approach aims to increase healthy thinking and effective behaviors, guiding you towards self-understanding, self-awareness, and self-growth.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-4 mt-8">Core Principles of My Practice:</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-4 mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Self-Understanding:</strong> Through telling your story and making sense of your past experiences.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> By becoming more mindful of your own thoughts, feelings, and needs.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Self-Growth:</strong> By identifying what is not working in your life (ineffective thought and behavior patterns, relationships), learning healthy coping strategies, and making conscious choices that lead to contentment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-4 mt-8">Therapeutic Modalities I Utilize:</h2>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are deeply connected. By changing the way we think, we can change the way we feel and act.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>How it helps:</strong> Helps you identify unhelpful or distorted thought patterns (like “I’m not good enough” or “Something bad will definitely happen”) and learn to challenge and reframe them into more balanced, realistic perspectives. CBT is present-focused and goal-oriented, providing practical tools and strategies to manage anxiety, depression, and self-doubt. It helps you become your own therapist.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Informed Strategies</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Grounded in the idea that two seemingly opposite things can be true at the same time—most notably, that we can accept ourselves as we are while also working toward self-acceptance and meaningful change. This balance of acceptance and change is at the heart of DBT.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                <strong>Core Skill Areas:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-4 mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Developing present-moment awareness and the ability to observe and experience thoughts and emotions without judgment.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Distress Tolerance:</strong> Learning how to cope with crisis and intense emotions in healthier, more effective ways.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Emotion Regulation:</strong> Understanding and managing emotional responses so they don't feel out of control.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Interpersonal Effectiveness:</strong> Building and maintaining healthy relationships, learning how to assert needs, set boundaries, and handle conflict.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>How it helps:</strong> Helps people manage overwhelming emotions, improve relationships, and live more balanced, fulfilling lives.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Expressive Arts Therapy</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Grounded in the belief that creative expression can be a powerful pathway to healing, self-discovery, and personal growth. It’s not about being an artist or creating something "perfect"—it's about using the creative process to explore emotions, reduce stress, and make meaning of our inner experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>How it helps:</strong> Combines psychology and the creative arts. When words alone aren't enough to express deep pain, trauma, or complex emotions, art becomes a language of its own, allowing safe expression. Through drawing, painting, sculpting, collage, or other creative methods, clients are invited to explore thoughts and feelings in a way that's both reflective and freeing.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Mindfulness</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Maintaining a moment-by-moment awareness of our thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, through a non-judgmental lens. It involves acceptance, paying attention without believing there’s a “right” or “wrong” way to think or feel.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>How it helps:</strong> Your thoughts tune into what you’re sensing in the present moment rather than rehashing the past or imagining the future. You learn to make conscious choices and connect with your own body.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Existential Therapy</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Focuses on free will, self-determination, and the search for meaning—often centering on you rather than on the symptom. The approach emphasizes your capacity to make rational choices and to develop to your maximum potential.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Person-Centered Therapy</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Allows clients to take more of a lead in discussions so that, in the process, they will discover their own solutions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Strength-Based & Trauma-Informed Approach</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My practice is rooted in a **Strength-Based** perspective, recognizing and building upon your inherent capabilities and resources. Complementing this is a **Trauma-Informed Approach**, which acknowledges the widespread impact of trauma and integrates this understanding into all aspects of therapy, ensuring safety, trustworthiness, and empowerment.
            </p>
