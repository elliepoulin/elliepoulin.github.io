                My therapeutic approach is integrative, drawing from various modalities to tailor sessions to your unique needs. I believe in a collaborative process, where we work together to identify your goals and build upon your existing strengths. Therapy is a journey of self-discovery and growth, and I am here to guide and support you every step of the way.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Client-Centered Care</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                At the heart of my practice is a client-centered philosophy. This means that you are the expert on your own life, and my role is to facilitate your self-discovery and provide tools for growth. I offer a non-judgmental, empathetic, and confidential space where you can explore your thoughts and feelings openly without fear of criticism. Your voice and your experience are paramount in our sessions.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Evidence-Based Practices</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I incorporate a variety of evidence-based practices, adapting them to best serve your individual or relational needs. Some of the core modalities I draw from include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-4 mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Helps identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to emotional distress and unhelpful behaviors.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) Informed Strategies:</strong> Focuses on developing skills in mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) Principles:</strong> Particularly useful in couples and family therapy, this approach helps identify and transform negative emotional cycles and create secure attachments.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Family Systems Theory:</strong> Understands individuals within the context of their family and social systems, recognizing how these interactions influence behavior and well-being.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">Holistic Perspective</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I consider the whole person – mind, body, and spirit – and how various aspects of your life interact to influence your well-being. This includes looking at your relationships, lifestyle, values, and cultural background. My aim is to help you develop a comprehensive understanding of yourself and cultivate lasting positive change that extends beyond our sessions into all areas of your life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                My commitment is to provide compassionate, ethical, and effective therapy that empowers you to build resilience, enhance relationships, and lead a more fulfilling life.
