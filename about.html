            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Welcome. I'm Ellie Poulin, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) dedicated to helping individuals, couples, and families navigate life's challenges and foster healthier relationships. My passion lies in creating a supportive environment where you feel heard, understood, and empowered to make meaningful changes.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I believe that every individual possesses inherent strengths and the capacity for growth and healing. My role as a therapist is to provide a safe, non-judgmental, and collaborative space where you can explore your inner world, understand your patterns, and develop new ways of relating to yourself and others. I approach therapy with genuine empathy, cultural sensitivity, and a deep commitment to your well-being.
            </p>
