            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-4 mt-8">My Journey to Becoming a Therapist</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                It’s been my dream to be a mental health therapist since I was eleven years old! I was inspired to become a mental health therapist after one meeting with a school counselor while I was in sixth grade. I was deeply moved by her presence, attentiveness, and genuine care. This experience also sparked my curiosity and interest in learning more about psychology and mental health topics. It’s been a long journey to becoming a therapist, and I strive for my clients to feel heard, understood, significant, and supported through the process of change.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-4 mt-8">My Experience & Background</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                 I started working in the mental health field in 1999 until today, with a break in between to raise my two children. For the past six years I have worked with clients in a private practice setting, and before that, I worked at various non-profit mental health organizations in San Diego, California. Working at non-profit organizations, I gained experience with victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, grief and loss, addiction, foster kids, and residential treatment and partial hospitalization with children ages 12-17.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-4 mt-8">Personal Approach & Values</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I understand how deeply relational trauma can shape our sense of safety, identity, and connection. I specialize in helping others heal from the lasting impact of relationship abuse—including emotional, physical, and psychological harm. I provide a safe, supportive space to process your experiences, rebuild trust in yourself and others, and develop healthier patterns in relationships. Whether you're navigating the aftermath of a toxic partnership, struggling with self-worth, or working to break cycles rooted in early trauma, I bring both clinical expertise and deep empathy to support your healing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                My parents immigrated to the U.S. when I was five years old, and this experience gave me a deep understanding of the issues affecting immigrant families and bicultural individuals. I have been with my husband since 1999 and feel that I understand the ups and downs of marriage and parenting. I’ve lived in San Diego with my husband, our two kids, and our beloved dog, and I’m proud to serve this community with care, compassion, and deep respect for each person’s unique journey.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-4 mt-8">Why I Do What I Do</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                I’m committed to providing an empathetic, supportive, and non-judgmental space for self-exploration. I believe in the power of building strong therapeutic relationships based on empathy, respect, and collaboration, working toward meaningful change.
            </p>
