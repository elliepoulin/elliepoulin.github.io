                    My fee for a 50-minute individual session is $180. For couples and family sessions (60 minutes), the fee is $220. I offer a limited number of sliding scale slots based on financial need. Please contact me to discuss further if finances are a barrier to seeking support.

                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">What should I expect in the first session?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The first session is an opportunity for us to get to know each other. We'll discuss your reasons for seeking therapy, your goals, and answer any questions you may have about the therapeutic process. It's a low-pressure way to see if we're a good fit and to begin building our therapeutic relationship.

            <!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
            <div class="bg-accent-medium p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary-dark mb-3">How long does therapy last?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The duration of therapy varies greatly depending on your individual needs and goals. Some clients benefit from short-term, solution-focused therapy, while others may engage in longer-term work for deeper personal growth. We'll regularly check in on your progress and adjust our approach as needed.
